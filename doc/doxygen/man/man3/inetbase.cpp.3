.PP 
\fBinetbase\&.cpp\fP defines the class inet_socket\&. This class is used as base class in the hierarchy between socket and the next specific class\&. Inheriting classes are inet_dgram, inet_stream_client and inet_stream_server\&.
.PP
The class contains the data elements host and port\&. If the inheriting class is a client, like inet_stream_client or inet_dgram_client (via inet_dgram), this fields contain the remote peer\&. If the inheriting class is a server socket, this fields contain the address and the port to which the server is bound\&.

The getters, gethost() and getport() may be used for a server application to get the paramters of the remote peer\&.
